I am someone that enjoys a lot on their plate; from the age of 15, I have been working in public facing jobs and have honed my skills in communications with others. I also have good time management skills, balancing my five courses plus 20-hour work weeks while still maintaining a competitive average. I have travelled to over 10 countries across the world, many of them being solo. Through these trips I have learned how to talk to new people and connect with them on a personal level and build trust.</p></div></div>
